A guide to building the latest documentation from the source is on the [wiki](https://github.com/Jaloko/LightingEngine/wiki/Building-the-documentation).

## Building
The lighting engine uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to combine and minify JavaScript code into a single file.

To do this the npm packages need to be installed.
```
npm install
```
The source can be built with
```
npm run build
```
Or
```
npm run build-dev
